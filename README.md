## **Several reasons why users don't read Terms Of Service**
----

- **Lengthy and Complex Terms:** Many terms and conditions agreements are extensive, filled with legal jargon, and can be extremely time-consuming to read thoroughly. Users often choose to skip them due to the daunting nature of these documents.

- **Lack of Transparency:** Some websites deliberately obscure or bury important terms within these agreements, making it even more challenging for users to understand their rights and obligations.

- **Time Constraints:** Users often visit websites for specific purposes and may not have the time or patience to read through pages of legal text.

- **Trust in the Platform:** Some users assume that well-known websites and platforms have fair and reasonable terms, so they don't see the need to read them.

- **Limited Choice:** In many cases, users are presented with a "take it or leave it" scenario, where they must agree to the terms to use a service. This doesn't leave them with a real choice but to check the box.


## **How the application solves the problem**
----

- **Simplified Language:** Rewriting terms and conditions in plain, easily understandable language to ensure that users can comprehend their rights and responsibilities.

- **Highlighting Important Clauses:** Identifying key clauses or sections within the terms and conditions that users should pay attention to.

- **Summary or FAQ:** Providing a summary or frequently asked questions (FAQ) section that condenses the most critical information from the full agreement.

- **User Education:** Encouraging users to take the time to read and understand the terms and conditions, emphasizing the importance of knowing what they are agreeing to.

- **Opt-In for Specific Clauses:** Allowing users to opt-in or opt-out of specific terms, if applicable, to give them more control over their agreement.

- **Transparency:** Making the terms and conditions more accessible by placing them prominently on the website and ensuring they are easily accessible at any time.
